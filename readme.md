## Key Insights for Presentation

The different between Subscribers and Customers use. I found out that subscriber take a ride when they go to work and comeback from the wrok because most of thier trip was from 7-9AM and 16-18PM and from Monday to Friday. And I found out must of the customer take ride on weekend and for longe trip duration (compare to the trip duration for the subscribers) maybe the customer take ride just for fun.
